A simple webpage that lets you generate a team of 6 random pokemon each with 4 random attacks (within the movepool of the pokemon).

The possible pokemon can be restricted to a desired generation und legendaries can be excluded.

The data is taken from PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/).

Also, I don't care much for styling, so if anybody should be interested in adding some css, feel free!
